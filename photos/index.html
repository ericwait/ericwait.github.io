<p>Before I became a computational scientist, I was a professional photographer. The camera taught me to see—not just to look. To recognize patterns in chaos, to find structure in complexity, to tell stories that transcend language.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t separate skills from my technical work. They&rsquo;re the same skill applied to different domains.</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m composing a landscape photograph or architecting a GPU-accelerated imaging pipeline, I&rsquo;m asking the same fundamental questions: <em>What&rsquo;s the signal? What&rsquo;s the noise? How do I communicate what matters?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-artistic-lens-natural-photography">The Artistic Lens: Natural Photography</h2>
<p>Photography taught me to see the world as a system of patterns, light, and relationships. A compelling photograph doesn&rsquo;t just capture a moment—it reveals structure that was always there but rarely noticed.</p>
<p><strong>My Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental portraiture</strong> - Capturing subjects in context, revealing relationships between figure and landscape</li>
<li><strong>Pattern and texture</strong> - Finding order in natural chaos, whether in rock formations, water surfaces, or weather patterns</li>
<li><strong>Light as subject</strong> - Understanding how light defines form, creates mood, and directs attention</li>
<li><strong>The decisive moment</strong> - Recognizing when all elements align for maximum impact</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applied-photography-ai-solving-real-problems-at-scale">Applied Photography AI: Solving Real Problems at Scale</h2>
<p>Making sense of 200,000+ images isn&rsquo;t just a technical challenge—it&rsquo;s personal.</p>
<p>My wife curates our family calendar each year, going through 20,000+ annual photos to find the best moments for each month. Birthday photos for birthday months, holiday images for December, pictures featuring our pets—it&rsquo;s meaningful work, but time-consuming. The challenge combines technical quality assessment (sharp focus, good exposure, balanced composition) with semantic search (finding specific people, places, pets, or events).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ericwait/home-media-ai" target="_blank">Home Media AI</a>
</strong> is my open-source solution: an ML system that automatically identifies &ldquo;technically excellent and aesthetically pleasing&rdquo; images while providing rich searchability across subjects, locations, and hierarchical classifications. The system handles 700K+ files, maintains file integrity (never moves or deletes originals), and works with any classification system—from biological taxonomies to family photo categories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intersection philosophy in practice: artistic judgment (what makes a great photo?) meets technical implementation (how do we automate that at scale?). The goal isn&rsquo;t to replace human curation—it&rsquo;s to multiply it. Instead of reviewing 20,000 images, review the top 2,000 candidates the system surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Technical approach:</strong> Python/SQLAlchemy backend, MariaDB for scale, OpenCV/Pillow for image processing, YOLO for object detection and classification (identifying people, pets, objects), scikit-learn for quality assessment models. Everything checksummed and versioned for long-term family archival reliability.</p>

<h2 id="the-scientific-lens-computational-imaging">The Scientific Lens: Computational Imaging</h2>
<p>My technical work in scientific imaging isn&rsquo;t a departure from photography—it&rsquo;s an extension of it. The same principles that make a powerful photograph also make effective scientific visualizations.</p>
<p><strong>From Camera to Microscope:</strong>
At HHMI Janelia Research Campus and in my work on the <a href="../projects/hydra">Hydra Image Processor</a>
 and <a href="../projects/direct-5d-viewer">Direct 5D Viewer</a>
, I developed GPU-accelerated pipelines for fluorescence and multiphoton microscopy. These systems process terabyte-scale 5-dimensional datasets (x, y, z, channels, time) in real-time, leveraging human visual perception—motion detection, depth sensitivity, contrast recognition—to turn raw data into scientific insight.</p>
<p>The challenge isn&rsquo;t just computational—it&rsquo;s visual storytelling at the cellular level. How do you reveal biological processes hidden in noisy, high-dimensional data without introducing false conclusions through misleading visualizations?</p>
<p><strong>Key Techniques:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-channel composite imaging</strong> - Like HDR photography, merging multiple exposures (wavelengths) to reveal structure across dynamic ranges</li>
<li><strong>Temporal visualization</strong> - Creating meaningful representations of processes that unfold over hours or days</li>
<li><strong>3D volume rendering</strong> - Translating 3D spatial data into 2D representations that communicate depth and relationships</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis-driven visualization</strong> - Using visual design to test and communicate scientific hypotheses (see <a href="../projects/janelia">Janelia project</a>
 for methodology)</li>
</ul>
<p>The tools changed from lenses and sensors to CUDA kernels and GPUs, but the goal remains the same: <strong>make the invisible visible</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="from-lens-to-algorithm-the-bridge">From Lens to Algorithm: The Bridge</h2>
<p>The skills photography taught me translate directly to my computational work in ways that might not be obvious at first glance.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-recognition-in-noisy-data">Pattern Recognition in Noisy Data</h3>
<p><strong>In photography:</strong> Spotting compositional elements in a complex scene—the leading line hidden in shadows, the repeating forms that create rhythm, the negative space that defines the subject.</p>
<p><strong>In ML systems:</strong> Identifying signal in terabyte-scale biological datasets. Recognizing when an apparent pattern is real structure versus noise. Designing features that capture what matters.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The same visual intuition that helps me see compositional balance in a landscape helps me debug GPU kernel outputs by recognizing artifacts that look &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; even before running quantitative metrics.</p>
<h3 id="working-under-constraints">Working Under Constraints</h3>
<p><strong>In photography:</strong> Fixed focal length forces you to move, to find the angle that works. Limited dynamic range means choosing what to preserve in highlights versus shadows. Fleeting light means you get one chance.</p>
<p><strong>In production ML:</strong> Limited GPU memory means choosing which data to keep resident. Real-time latency requirements mean optimizing the critical path ruthlessly. Edge deployment means the model must work with what&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Photography taught me that <strong>constraints drive creativity</strong>. The best solutions emerge when you can&rsquo;t brute-force your way through—when you must understand the problem deeply enough to work elegantly within limits.</p>
<h3 id="communication-over-complexity">Communication Over Complexity</h3>
<p><strong>In photography:</strong> A great photograph communicates instantly. Technical perfection (sharpness, exposure, color accuracy) matters, but only in service of impact. If it doesn&rsquo;t communicate, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p><strong>In ML systems:</strong> A great model isn&rsquo;t just accurate—it&rsquo;s interpretable, deployable, and maintainable. Physics-informed approaches that encode domain knowledge often outperform black-box models with 10x the parameters. Clarity of design matters.</p>
<p>Ansel Adams said: <em>&ldquo;There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That applies equally to photography and to machine learning architectures.</p>
<h3 id="patience--timing">Patience &amp; Timing</h3>
<p><strong>In photography:</strong> Waiting for the right light. Returning to a location multiple times. Understanding that some images require time—you can&rsquo;t force them.</p>
<p><strong>In technical work:</strong> Debugging complex CUDA pipelines. Recognizing when to optimize versus when to pivot. Understanding that some problems require deep investigation—you can&rsquo;t hack your way through.</p>
<p>Photography taught me the difference between <strong>persistence</strong> (doing the same thing longer) and <strong>patience</strong> (waiting for the right conditions to act). Both matter in technical work.</p>

<h2 id="the-philosophy-learning-to-see-without-the-camera">The Philosophy: Learning to See Without the Camera</h2>
<p><em>&ldquo;The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.&rdquo;</em> — Dorothea Lange</p>
<p>This quote captures why photography made me a better computational scientist. The camera was never the point—it was a tool for learning to see.</p>
<p>What photography really taught me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure exists in apparent chaos</strong> - Whether in a forest or a high-dimensional dataset</li>
<li><strong>Context defines meaning</strong> - A pixel value means nothing without understanding its relationships</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity is hard</strong> - Both in composition and in system design</li>
<li><strong>The best solution often requires subtracting, not adding</strong> - In photography, knowing what to leave out of the frame is as important as what to include. In ML systems, <a href="../#-lets-discuss-efficient-ai">knowing which computation you don&rsquo;t need to do</a>
 is the ultimate optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>My approach to technical work—physics-informed machine learning, GPU optimization, hypothesis-driven design—all stem from this fundamental skill: <strong>learning to see what&rsquo;s really there</strong>.</p>
