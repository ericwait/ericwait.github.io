      <description>This will be an ever changing list of quotes. The ones on top of the list will be those most recently encountered by me. Check back often if you are looking for a memorable thing to quote.
  Moral decisions should not be imposed by immoral people.

  The great enemy of communication, we find, is the illusion of it. We have talked enough; but we have not listened.</description>

      <description>I was born in the 80&amp;rsquo;s in a mid-size town in Wisconsin. I feel like my start was quite unassuming. My family had a heavy work ethic and would unwind in true Wisconsin fasion at the end of each week. I spent many of my earlier days playing on or around the Chippewa river. This is where I learned to waterski and enjoy the outdoors. I worked hard through my high school years to the point where I drop some of my extra curricular activities.</description>
