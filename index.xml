      <description>I was born in the 80&amp;rsquo;s in a mid-size town in Wisconsin. I feel like my start was quite unassuming. My family had a heavy work ethic and would unwind in true Wisconsin fasion at the end of each week. I spent many of my earlier days playing on or around the Chippewa river. This is where I learned to waterski and enjoy the outdoors. I worked hard through my high school years to the point where I drop some of my extra curricular activities.</description>
