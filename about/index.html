<p>I&rsquo;m a Principal Data Scientist with over a decade of experience architecting GPU-accelerated machine learning systems that process terabyte-scale data in real-time. But what drives me isn&rsquo;t just technical excellence - it&rsquo;s the opportunity to be part of projects that push boundaries and bring meaningful impact to the world.</p>
<p>I thrive when tackling problems that matter: accelerating cancer diagnostics, enabling biological discoveries published in Nature, building open-source tools used by researchers globally. I&rsquo;m motivated by influence on big ideas and the chance to contribute to something larger than myself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="at-a-glance">At a Glance</h2>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving Approach:</strong> Reverse-Thinking methodology (start with success, work backward) — published in <em>Journal of Cell Science</em> (2020)</p>
<p><strong>Technical Depth:</strong> GPU/ML systems • Physics-informed approaches • Terabyte-scale data processing • Custom CUDA kernels</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Style:</strong> Multiply impact through mentorship and strategic alignment • Product vision to production reality • Cross-functional team direction</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Building systems that matter - cancer diagnostics, Nature publications, open-source tools democratizing GPU computing</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> 21 years military (Command Post Superintendent, 2x Meritorious Service Medal) + elite research institutions (HHMI Janelia) + startup product leadership (Elephas Biosciences)</p>
<p><strong>Key Philosophy:</strong> The best optimization is the computation you don&rsquo;t have to do • Human-centered AI that amplifies capability • Innovation at intersections</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-think-reverse-engineering-solutions">How I Think: Reverse-Engineering Solutions</h2>
<p>My problem-solving approach comes from years advising scientists at <strong>HHMI Janelia Research Campus</strong>, where I developed a philosophy I call &ldquo;reverse-thinking&rdquo;: start with what success looks like, then work backward to determine what you need to get there.</p>
<p>This methodology prevents building capabilities that don&rsquo;t serve the ultimate goal. I don&rsquo;t start with available tools or technologies - I start by defining what an informative answer would look like, translating ambiguity into measurable metrics, then determining the minimum path to achieve it.</p>
<p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Design is about exclusion, not inclusion. The best solutions carefully exclude unnecessary complexity while focusing resources on what actually matters.</p>
<p>This approach shaped my technical contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>At <strong>Janelia</strong>, I pioneered hypothesis-driven experimental design, advising 170+ international scientists on translating vague biological questions into rigorous quantitative experiments - contributing to publications in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, and <em>Journal of Cell Science</em></li>
<li>In <strong>Fortune 500 consulting</strong>, I optimized transportation networks by selecting mathematical approaches that fundamentally reduced the problem space, eliminating unnecessary computations entirely and cutting runtime from days to hours</li>
<li>At <strong>Elephas Biosciences</strong>, I directed cross-functional teams to build cancer diagnostics platforms by defining success metrics first (90% reduction in analysis time, multi-site reproducibility), then architecting systems to achieve them</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2 id="how-i-execute-product-vision-to-production-reality">How I Execute: Product Vision to Production Reality</h2>
<p>Technical brilliance means little without execution discipline. At <strong>Elephas Biosciences</strong> as Principal Data Scientist, I led the full lifecycle from research prototype to production-ready clinical tools - but more importantly, I helped shape the product vision itself.</p>
<p><strong>Product Vision &amp; Strategic Planning:</strong> I don&rsquo;t just implement roadmaps - I help define them. My sense of wonderment about what&rsquo;s possible drives product innovation: &ldquo;What if we could make advanced microscopy accessible to any lab?&rdquo; &ldquo;What if cancer diagnostics could happen in hours instead of days?&rdquo; &ldquo;What if the computation could happen on the instrument in real-time?&rdquo; I translate this curiosity into concrete product strategies, collaborating with biology, engineering, marketing, and finance teams to balance ambitious vision with market realities and resource constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong> Led teams spanning software developers, biologists, and engineers - not just coordinating their work, but aligning everyone around a shared product vision. Recruited talent, instituted Git workflows and CI/CD pipelines, developed training programs for multi-site consistency. The key was ensuring every team member understood not just <em>what</em> we were building, but <em>why it mattered</em> and <em>who it would help</em>.</p>
<p><strong>From Wonderment to Deployment:</strong> My curiosity about &ldquo;what could be&rdquo; drives initial vision, but discipline delivers results. The result: 90%+ reduction in analysis time, reproducible results across laboratory locations, and FDA-aligned systems that transitioned from research curiosity to production clinical tools.</p>
<p><strong>Production-Ready Systems:</strong> In regulated medical diagnostics, reproducibility isn&rsquo;t optional. I brought operational discipline from military training to software development - version control, automated testing, complete documentation, and rigorous validation frameworks. This enabled successful deployment of cancer diagnostics platforms that started as &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; questions and became real products impacting patient care.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="how-i-build-long-term-excellence">How I Build: Long-Term Excellence</h2>
<p>I believe in building tools that last. <strong>Hydra Image Processor</strong> - my open-source GPU-accelerated image analysis library - exemplifies this commitment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12+ years of continuous development</strong> - First commit in August 2013, still being used and improved today</li>
<li><strong>100x speedups</strong> over CPU implementations through custom CUDA kernels</li>
<li><strong>Peer-reviewed</strong> publication in <em>Bioinformatics</em> (2019)</li>
<li><strong>Globally adopted</strong> by research institutions worldwide</li>
<li><strong>Still actively used</strong> because I prioritized accessible interfaces (Python/MATLAB wrappers) over raw performance alone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The lesson:</strong> The best optimization is one people actually use. Technical depth matters, but so does thoughtful design that serves users&rsquo; real workflows.</p>
<p>This philosophy extends beyond code. My publications in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Journal of Cell Science</em>, and <em>IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging</em> reflect commitment to rigorous, reproducible science that advances entire fields - not just individual projects.</p>
<p><a href="../projects/hydra">Read about Hydra&rsquo;s technical approach →</a>
</p>
<h2 id="my-technical-philosophy">My Technical Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe the best optimization is often the computation you don&rsquo;t have to do.</p>
<p>By incorporating physical constraints and domain knowledge into ML systems, I build solutions that are more efficient and interpretable than purely data-driven approaches. This stems from my background in optics, signal processing, and real-world deployment - understanding that successful systems must respect both computational and physical limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Domain-informed optimization</strong> isn&rsquo;t just faster - it&rsquo;s more interpretable, more trustworthy, and more aligned with how the world actually works. Understanding the physics of your problem space lets you eliminate unnecessary computation and focus resources where they matter.</p>
<h2 id="military-foundation-operational-discipline--high-stakes-leadership">Military Foundation: Operational Discipline &amp; High-Stakes Leadership</h2>
<p><strong>21 years in the Air National Guard</strong> (Command Post Superintendent, 2x Meritorious Service Medal recipient) shaped how I lead technical teams and build production systems.</p>
<p><strong>Core principles learned:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Communication Under Pressure:</strong> Coordinating real-time operations and briefing senior leadership at the Pentagon taught me that clarity isn&rsquo;t optional—it&rsquo;s survival. This discipline carries into my technical work: explaining CUDA kernel optimizations to engineers, presenting strategic options to executives, translating complexity into actionable clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Training as Force Multiplier:</strong> Earned the Meritorious Service Medal twice (highest peacetime award for non-commissioned officers) for innovation in training systems. Great leaders don&rsquo;t do everything themselves—they build capability in others. At Janelia, I trained 170+ international scientists on experimental design. At Elephas, I developed training programs ensuring consistent practices across multiple lab sites.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Discipline:</strong> Military operations demand reproducibility, documentation, and validation. Lives depend on systems working correctly under pressure. This mindset translates directly to medical diagnostics and production AI systems—where reproducibility is what allows innovation to become trustworthy clinical tools.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Functional Coordination:</strong> Command posts unite intelligence, operations, logistics, and communications—groups with different languages and priorities. I learned to bridge these gaps, translating needs between domains while keeping everyone aligned on the mission. This same skill enabled me to direct cross-functional teams at Elephas (biology, engineering, software, marketing, finance) and Janelia (biologists, physicists, computational scientists).</p>

</p>
<h2 id="leadership-philosophy-multiply-impact-through-others">Leadership Philosophy: Multiply Impact Through Others</h2>
<p>I believe the best technical leaders multiply impact through mentorship and strategic alignment - knowing when to code and when to enable others to succeed.</p>
<p>My approach balances technical depth with human-centered leadership. I can write CUDA kernels when needed, but I recognize that building systems that others can maintain and extend creates more lasting impact than brilliant code only I understand.</p>
<p><strong>At Elephas:</strong> Built teams, recruited talent, instituted engineering best practices (Git, CI/CD, documentation), and aligned technical roadmaps with business strategy. The result wasn&rsquo;t just working software - it was sustainable systems and empowered teams.</p>
<p><strong>At Janelia:</strong> Advised hundreds of researchers not by solving their problems for them, but by teaching them frameworks to solve problems systematically. The reverse-thinking methodology I developed gets passed researcher-to-researcher, multiplying impact far beyond individual consultations.</p>
<h2 id="the-intersection-philosophy">The Intersection Philosophy</h2>
<p>Before becoming a computational scientist, I was a professional photographer. That artistic training taught me to see patterns, frame complex information visually, and tell stories with data. I believe innovation happens at intersections: art and science, logic and creativity, vision and persistence.</p>
<p>This philosophy drives my technical approach - whether building GPU-accelerated pipelines that visualize terabyte-scale datasets or designing ML systems that incorporate domain knowledge for efficiency and interpretability. The discipline of composing an image - understanding light, timing, and perspective - mirrors the discipline of designing computational systems that humans can trust and understand.</p>
<h2 id="driven-by-impact-altruism-and-big-ideas">Driven by Impact: Altruism and Big Ideas</h2>
<p>What truly motivates me is being part of something bigger than myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m energized by projects that seek to be the best or bring the most good back to the world. My sense of wonderment - asking &ldquo;what if this could work differently?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what if we could make this accessible to everyone?&rdquo; - drives product innovation that serves meaningful missions. Whether it&rsquo;s accelerating cancer diagnostics to help patients, enabling biological discoveries that advance human understanding, or building open-source tools that democratize access to GPU computing - I want my work to matter beyond the immediate deliverable.</p>
<p>This is why I chose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Janelia Research Campus</strong> - supporting cutting-edge science that pushes the boundaries of biological understanding</li>
<li><strong>Elephas Biosciences</strong> - building diagnostics platforms that could improve cancer treatment outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Open-source contributions</strong> - Hydra Image Processor freely available so researchers without resources can still leverage GPU acceleration</li>
<li><strong>Military service</strong> - 21 years defending something larger than individual interests</li>
</ul>
<p>I thrive in environments where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambitious vision</strong> drives the organization (being the best, solving hard problems, creating new capabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Mission matters</strong> beyond profit (improving health, advancing science, serving society)</li>
<li><strong>My influence scales</strong> through leadership, mentorship, and systems that outlive individual contributions</li>
<li><strong>Technical excellence serves purpose</strong> - not just impressive for its own sake, but enabling real impact</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in incremental improvements to established markets. I want to help build what hasn&rsquo;t been built before, solve problems that others say can&rsquo;t be solved, and create tools that empower entire communities.</p>
<p>If your organization is trying to push boundaries, make meaningful impact, and needs technical leadership that balances vision with execution discipline - that&rsquo;s where I belong.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-bring-to-organizations">What I Bring to Organizations</h2>
<p><strong>Technical Depth:</strong> GPU computing, domain-informed ML optimization, production AI systems processing terabyte-scale data in real-time. I can architect systems from scratch or optimize existing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Product Vision &amp; Innovation:</strong> I don&rsquo;t just build what&rsquo;s asked for - I help discover what should be built. My sense of wonderment about what&rsquo;s possible drives product innovation, asking &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; questions that become concrete strategies. I translate curiosity into market-ready products while balancing ambitious vision with practical constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving Methodology:</strong> Reverse-thinking framework translating ambiguous challenges into measurable solutions. I help teams move from &ldquo;what can we build?&rdquo; to &ldquo;what should we build to achieve the goal?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong> 21 years military service, cross-functional team leadership across academia and startups, proven track record mentoring teams to deliver production systems. I align teams around shared product vision, ensuring everyone understands not just <em>what</em> we&rsquo;re building, but <em>why it matters</em> and <em>who it helps</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Translate technical capabilities into business strategies, balance innovation with constraints, ensure engineering roadmaps serve organizational objectives. I collaborate with marketing, finance, and executive teams to shape product direction - understanding that great technology means nothing without successful deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Communication Excellence:</strong> Bridge technical and non-technical audiences - from explaining CUDA kernel optimizations to engineers, to presenting strategic options to executives, to training scientists on experimental design.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Discipline:</strong> Military-instilled focus on reproducibility, documentation, validation. I build systems that meet regulatory requirements, scale reliably, and teams can maintain long-term.</p>
<h2 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s Connect</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about roles where I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape product vision and strategy - asking &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; and turning wonderment into concrete roadmaps</li>
<li>Build production ML systems that push efficiency boundaries</li>
<li>Lead cross-functional teams to deliver ambitious visions</li>
<li>Contribute to projects that make meaningful impact on science, health, or society</li>
<li>Multiply my influence through mentorship, open-source contributions, and systems that outlive me</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tackling problems that matter - whether it&rsquo;s <strong>product vision for domain-informed ML systems</strong>, <strong>technical leadership for breakthrough diagnostics</strong>, <strong>strategic planning for ambitious scientific tools</strong>, or <strong>building systems that haven&rsquo;t been built before</strong> - I&rsquo;d love to discuss how reverse-thinking methodology, curiosity-driven innovation, and execution discipline can turn vision into reality.</p>

      <h2 id="wisconsin-roots">Wisconsin Roots</h2>
<p>Born in the 1980s in a mid-sized Wisconsin town, I spent my early years on the Chippewa River - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zAS1rhpwZS2k.k2-ecmkfhNYg" target="_blank">waterskiing</a>
, exploring outdoors, and absorbing my family&rsquo;s strong work ethic.
But I wanted more than the path immediately visible to me.</p>
<p>The solution: join the Air National Guard and pursue college.
Military service would prove I could work hard and deliver under pressure.
College would provide knowledge that experience alone couldn&rsquo;t teach.
Looking back, it was my first exercise in reverse-thinking - identifying what success looked like, then working backward to achieve it.</p>
