<p>I&rsquo;m a Principal Data Scientist with over a decade of experience architecting GPU-accelerated machine learning systems that process terabyte-scale data in real-time.
My unique approach combines domain knowledge with modern AI to create interpretable, efficient solutions that respect the physics of the problem space.</p>
<h2 id="from-photography-to-physics-informed-ai">From Photography to Physics-Informed AI</h2>
<p>My journey spans visual arts, military service, and computational science - experiences that taught me to see patterns others miss.
At <strong>Elephas Biosciences</strong>, I led development of multi-modal ML systems that reduced inference latency by 60% through custom CUDA implementations.
Previously at <strong>HHMI&rsquo;s Janelia Research Campus</strong>, I built GPU-accelerated algorithms processing hundreds of terabytes of imaging data, achieving 10x speedups while maintaining scientific rigor.
My work in <strong>Fortune 500 consulting</strong> optimized transportation networks, cutting computational runtime from days to hours through physics-informed optimization.</p>
<h2 id="my-technical-philosophy">My Technical Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe the best optimization is often the computation you don&rsquo;t have to do.
By encoding physical constraints and domain knowledge directly into neural architectures, I build AI systems that require 80% less training data while generalizing better than purely data-driven approaches.
This philosophy stems from my background in optics, signal processing, and real-world deployment constraints - understanding that successful ML systems must respect both computational and physical limitations.</p>
<h2 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s Connect</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about roles where I can build production ML systems that push efficiency boundaries through physics-informed design.
Whether you&rsquo;re interested in <strong>GPU optimization</strong>, <strong>constrained machine learning</strong>, or <strong>building AI systems that actually work in production</strong> - I&rsquo;d love to discuss how domain knowledge can make AI both more effective and more interpretable.</p>

      <p>I was born in the 80&rsquo;s in a mid-size town in Wisconsin.
I feel like my start was quite unassuming.
My family had a heavy work ethic and would unwind in true Wisconsin fashion at the end of each week.
I spent many of my earlier days playing on or around the Chippewa river.
This is where I learned to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zAS1rhpwZS2k.k2-ecmkfhNYg" target="_blank">waterski</a>
 and enjoy the outdoors.
I worked hard through my high school years to the point where I dropped some of my extra curricular activities.
Hard work and the meager wealth that would bring was always the emphasis from my parents.
I wanted more though.
I found that joining the Air National Guard and attending college was a good compromise.
The military would show that I could work hard and college would help me learn something that could not be had through experience alone.</p>
