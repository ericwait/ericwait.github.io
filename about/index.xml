      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in the 80&amp;rsquo;s in a mid-size town in Wisconsin.&#xA;I feel like my start was quite unassuming.&#xA;My family had a heavy work ethic and would unwind in true Wisconsin fashion at the end of each week.&#xA;I spent many of my earlier days playing on or around the Chippewa river.&#xA;This is where I learned to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zAS1rhpwZS2k.k2-ecmkfhNYg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waterski&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; and enjoy the outdoors.&#xA;I worked hard through my high school years to the point where I dropped some of my extra curricular activities.&#xA;Hard work and the meager wealth that would bring was always the emphasis from my parents.&#xA;I wanted more though.&#xA;I found that joining the Air National Guard and attending college was a good compromise.&#xA;The military would show that I could work hard and college would help me learn something that could not be had through experience alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
